# Start live streaming with Livepeer.com 

## (no code required)

There are multiple ways to livestream with Livepeer.com. The only prerequisite for using livepeer.com is to be able to create an RTMP stream. 

You can integrate your streaming application directly with the Livepeer.com API. Or you can use the Livepeer.com Dashboard to live stream without writing any code. 

In this quick tutorial, you will learn how to create a unique stream object, broadcast live video content and playback your live stream with Livepeer.com.

### 1&#46;Create a stream

Login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and navigate to the streams list page, [livepeer.com/app/user](/app/user). Click on the Create button. When you name your stream, pick a unique name and include URL compatible characters only.

Then you’ll be redirected to a detailed page with information about your new stream. Keep this page open. You will need this information for configuring OBS in step 2 and playing back your live stream in step 3.

### 2&#46;Broadcast live video using OBS

OBS is free and open source software for live streaming. [Download and install OBS.](https://obsproject.com/download)

Before streaming, we need to configure OBS. Slick on Settings in the lower right corner.

First, let’s set the keyframe interval.

1. In the Settings sidebar menu, select Output.
2. At the top, select Advanced from the Output Mode dropdown.
3. In the Keyframe Interval row, input 2 in the text field.

Next, let’s configure OBS to point to Livepeer.com’s RTMP ingest data centers.

1. In the Setting sidebar menu, select Stream.
2. At the top, select Custom from the Service dropdown menu.
3. Input `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live` in the Server text field.
4. Navigate to the stream detail page, click the “Show secret stream key” button, and copy the stream key

5. Navigate back to OBS, and paste your stream key into the Stream Key text field
6. Confirm the Use Authentication checkbox is unchecked.
7. Click OK in the lower right corner to save your updated server and keyframe interval settings.

When you are ready to start your live stream, click Start Streaming in the lower right corner of OBS.

### 3&#46;Playback your live stream

Navigate to your stream detail page in the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and copy the Playback URL, `https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`. The playback URL is an M3U8 file, the basis for the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) format.

Livepeer.com doesn’t have it’s own player, but works with open source and 3rd party players. For this tutorial, we will use [Theo Player’s demo player](https://demo.theoplayer.com/test-your-stream-with-statistics).

Paste your playback URL in the text field at the top of Theo Player’s demo player and click to load your stream. You may need to also press the Play button in the player.

That’s it! Streaming with Livepeer.com is that simple. To get in touch, fill out a [contact form](/contact).
