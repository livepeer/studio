## How do I import a Live stream into my Assets?

Livepeer live stream recordings are automatically imported as `Asset` objects.
All you need to do is enable recording on your streams.

When the stream session ends, the platform waits `6min` to give a chance for the
user to reconnect on the same recording session. After that delay, the recording
is processed and you should have a new asset in your account which you can
retrieve from the list assets API.
