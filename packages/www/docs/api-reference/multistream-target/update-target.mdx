# `PATCH` update a multistream target

`PATCH /multistream/target/{id}` updates an existing `multistream target`
object. You can change any user-defined field in the current object,
specifically `name`, `url` and `disabled`. For more information about them check
`multistream target` object schema in
[Overview](/docs/api-reference/multistream-target/overview).

All fields are optional, and if any field is not included in the request payload
it will be kept unchanged from the saved object.

You cannot access the current `url` field for updating it since we redact it
from GET responses. If you want to update the URL you have to build it from
scratch. You can also omit it from the `PATCH` payload to keep it as is.

A `204 No Content` status response indicates the `multistrema target` was
successfully updated.

### Disabling a target

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target/{id}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
    "disabled": true
}'
```

### Changing the target URL

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target/{id}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
    "url": "srt://rtmp.service.com/live?streamId=SECRET"
}'
```

### Updating all fields

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target/{id}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
    "name": "Not My Original Target Anymore",
    "url": "rtmp://rtmp.real.service.com/SECRET"
    "disabled": false
}'
```
