# `POST` create a multistream target

`POST /multistream/target` creates a `multistream target` object. The only
parameter you are required to set is the `url` of your target. The `name` will
be derived from the `url` host, if not specified.

Notice that only creating a `multistream target` is not enough for multistream
to start happening. You also need to reference the target from the `stream` that
you want to be multistreamed. Refer to
[Multistream](/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/multistream) guide for more
information.

Here is an example request:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://livepeer.com/api/multistream/target' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{
    "name": "My Multistream Target",
    "url": "rtmp://rtmp.streaming.tv/live/SECRET"
}'
```
