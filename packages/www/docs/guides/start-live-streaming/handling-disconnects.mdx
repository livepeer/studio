# Handling disconnects

Sometimes, after you’ve connected your encoder (for example, OBS) to and Livepeer.com RTMP server, the connection drops. For example, this could happen because of a bug in the encoder software or a problem with the streamer’s internet connection. 

Do not worry, Livepeer.com has a built-in 5 minute reconnect window. This means that if the streamer’s encoder disconnects and then reconnects within 5 minutes, the session will resume. If you are using Livepeer.com recording feature, the recorded session will not be split into two separate sessions.

Right now, the reconnect window is not customizable.
