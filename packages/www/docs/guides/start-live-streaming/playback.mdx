# Playback a live stream

This is how a Livepeer.com playback URL is formatted:
`https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

All sessions for a stream have the same playback URL.

The easiest way to the stream a playback URL is to login to the Livepeer.com
Dashboard, navigate to the Streams page,
[livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams), and
click on a stream name. The playback URL is listed on the page.

You can also make a `GET` request to `https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}`, and
get the value of `playbackId` in the response. The playback URL can then be
formatted as above: `https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

### Example code

#### cURL Method

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
```

#### Node.js with Axios Method

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

axios
  .get("https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer {api_key}",
    },
  })
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data));
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## Video player

Users can view the live stream with any HLS video player (for example
[video.js](https://videojs.com/) or [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/)).

## Stream delivery via CDN

Playback for all Pro plan streams is delivered via a content delivery network
(CDN). The transcoded video stream automatically switches between the transcoded
renditions based on the viewers' available bandwidth, device performance, and
network conditions.

Non-CDN delivery for free tier users is limited to 10 viewers per account.

## What if playback isn't working?

Look at the `lastSeen` and `isActive` (Status row on the Livepeer.com Dashboard)
values. If ingest was properly configured for playback, `lastSeen` will show the
current date and time and `isActive` will be `true` (Status row on the
Livepeer.com Dashboard will be Active).

If this isn't the case, confirm the `streamKey` and RTMP ingest URL,
`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live`, are configured correctly in your broadcast
software.

Lastly, check that your playback URL is correct.

## Audio-only streams

You can use `?video=false` at the end of an `.m3u8` URL to get an audio-only
stream. For example,
`https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8?video=false`.
