# **Using Webhooks**

Livepeer.com uses webhooks to communicate with your application asynchronously when events for your stream occur. For example, you may want to know when a stream has become active or idle, so that you can surface this information to viewers. When these events happen, we’ll make a `POST` request to a URL that you specify.

### How to configure endpoints

Webhook endpoints are specific for each `event`. Once the event is registered, all streams for this account will be triggering the specific event. Here is an example of registering for the `stream.started` and `stream.idle` events:

``` 
curl \
    -X POST \
    -H "authorization: Bearer {api_key}" \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    --data-raw '{
      "events": ["stream.started", "stream.idle"],
      "url": "{webhook_url}",
      "name": "test webhooks"
  }' \
  https://livepeer.com/api/webhook`
```

This request should return:

```
{
      "createdAt" : 1624939859628,
      "events": ["stream.started", "stream.idle"],
      "id" : "e7b8a281-8952-4791-b837-183cb95bbf32",
      "kind" : "webhook",
      "name" : "test webhooks",
      "url" : "{webhook_endpoint}",
      "userId" : "ffcd3b74-9908-4d23-be05-58e1480e752a"
}

```

Now all streams will trigger the `stream.started` and `stream.idle` events for this account.

### Other webhooks endpoints

`GET /api/webhook`: Get a list of webhooks

`GET /api/webhook/:webhookID`: Get a single webhook Object details

`PUT /api/webhook/:webhookID`: Edit a webhook, using the same parameters as POST /webhook

`DEL /api/webhook/:webhookID`: Delete a webhook

### Types of Events

|           Name  | Description                |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|stream.started|The "parent" stream object's isActive value is marked as true and the .m3u8 HLS URL works          |
|stream.idle          |The “parent” stream object’s isActive value should be marked as false and the .m3u8 HLS URL no longer works         |
|recording.ready         |This fires when a recording is ready to be downloaded|
|recording.started|This fires when recording has started on an active stream
|recording.waiting|This fires after a stream with recording on has concluded and is not yet ready to be downloaded. Typically it takes 5 minutes for recordings to be ready for download.
|multistream.connected|This fires when we've successfully connected to the multistream target
|multistream.error|This fires when we've encountered an error either while attempting to connect to the third party streaming service or while broadcasting.
|multistream.disconnected|This fires when we are no longer sending video to the multistream target
