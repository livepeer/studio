# Monitoring Stream Health

To monitor any active stream for issues that may impact the quality of your
stream, navigate to the Stream Health tab on the stream detail page.

During any Active stream, components on this page will display a variety of
health indicators.

## Global Health Status

- `Healthy` indicates that all of the Health Checks are in a `Healthy` state.
- `Unhealthy` indicates that one or more of the Health Checks are in an
  `Unhealthy` state
- `Idle` indicates that the stream is not currently active

## Health Checks

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79172645/135450340-4abed968-df77-473d-b926-88c11b5799d2.png)

- **_Transcoding_** — A `Healthy` status indicates that video transcoding is
  occurring and the multiple profiles of your stream are available for playback.
  An `Unhealthy` status indicates that we have failed to generate the profiles
  so only the original video will be available. Check the event log below for
  any actionable errors or check the
  [Status page](https://livepeer.statuspage.io/) for platform-wide issues.
- **_Real-time —_** This indicates whether our system is transcoding the stream
  faster than real time, in other words, if the video transcode latency is lower
  than the video duration. An `Unhealthy` status may be caused by unconventional
  configurations. Check your stream software configuration by following the
  steps
  [in this article,](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/debug-live-stream-issues)
  and restart your stream.
- **_Multistreaming —_** This health check indicates whether all configured
  `Multistream Targets` are connected. If no targets are configured, this will
  show up as blank and not be considered for the global health state. If this
  shows up as `Unhealthy` you can also check the status of the individual
  `Multistream Targets` in the `Overivew` tab, where the targets can be either
  `Idle`, `Pending`, `Online`or `Offline`:

  - An `Idle` status indicates that the stream is not currently active so
    neither is multistreaming.
  - A `Pending` status indicates that our system is trying to connect to the
    respective `Multistream Target`.
  - An `Online` status indicates that the `Multistream Target` is successfully
    connected.
  - An `Offline` status means that we've received an error when trying to
    connect to the target. To try again, check the ingest URL and stream key of
    your destination service, re-configure your `Multistream Target` and restart
    your stream.

  ## Logs

  Logs will surface informational alerts (ex. stream has started/stopped,
  multistream destinations have connected/disconnected) or any fatal errors from
  the transcoding process. Here is an example of a fatal error:

  ```bash
  Transcode error from ewr-prod-livepeer-orchestrator-0 for segment 0:
  **Unsupported input pixel format**
  ```

If you run into this or any similar errors, check the configuration in your
streaming software (e.g. OBS) and restart the stream.

## Session Ingest Rate

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79172645/135467197-08ec63ab-4c44-4cad-a0d5-95a76b80e5c5.png)

Session ingest rate tells you the bitrate of the video received by Livepeer
ingest servers, updated every 10 seconds. A high bitrate is suggestive that
streams into the Livepeer system are high quality, your encoder is working
properly, and your internet connection is good. A fluctuating or low bitrate may
suggest that your encoder is configured improperly or that the streamer internet
connection isn't as strong as it should be to deliver high quality streams to
your viewers.

## Stream Health API

The Stream Health information can also be queried using a separate `/data` API
endpoint. To use the `/data` API you need to include the same API key as the one
used for the regular API, check
[API key documentation](/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/api-key) for more
information.

The Stream Health API uses a slightly different hostname than the regular API,
specifically `origin.livepeer.com`. It consists of the following endpoints:

- `/data/stream/{streamId}/health`: Grabs the latest health status info about a
  given stream, referenced by its Stream ID. This API powers the dashboard
  healthchecks and multistream status.
- `/data/stream/{streamId}/events`: Provides direct access to the low-level
  events sent by Livepeer video processing services. It also allows subscribing
  via SSE to receive new events live, and is useful for debugging. This API
  powers the log feed in the dashboard.

    Note: The Stream Health API is currently in <code>Beta</code> and we don't
    guarantee long-term stability on all the interfaces. Make sure to align with
    our customer support team before releasing applications that depend on it.

Now let's go into more detail on each of the Stream Health API endpoints.

In the above response payload:

- All timestamps are representend in milliseconds since the Unix epoch, which is
  the default representation of timestamps across all the Livepeer API.
- The healthy top-level condition is a computed state based on some specific
  conditions of the stream. As of writing this doc, a stream is considered
  healthy if it's both active, transcoding in realtime, and if multistream
  targets are configured that they are also healthy.
- The conditions array contains more specific information about the stream
  healthy state, with the `type` field specifying what the condition means.
- More generally, a `Condition` represents a specific state of the stream
  health.
  - The `status` field represents the value of the last reading for that
    condition, and the `lastProbeTime` specifies when that was.
  - The `lastTransitionsTime` and the `frequency` fields provide some insight on
    how it's changing over time.
  - The `lastTransitionTime` is the timestamp of the last time where the
    condition status changed, and;
  - The `frequency` is the ratio of truthful readings in the past specified
    timestamps.
- The `metrics` are still an experimental API and is not recommended for use in
  production systems. But the `last` field is basically a tuple containing the
  `timestamp` and the `value` of the last reading for that metric.

### Events

The `/events` API response implements the
[Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)
API and can be consumed using any client that supports the SSE protocol. On
JavaScript, we recomend using the
[`eventsource`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eventsource) NPM package to be
able to add an `Authorization` header to the API request.

The individual events sent over the SSE stream are all JSON objects, and are
exactly the same low-level objects as published by the Open Source
infrastructure services running in the Livepeer infrastructure. Some fields are
always present, specifically:

- `type`: the unique type of the event, which defines the structure of the rest
  of the JSON object.
- `id`: a unique identifier for the event, which is used to match the event, and
  which is automatically used by SSE clients to recover a connection without
  losing events.
- `timestamp`: the timestamp of the event, in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

You can also get a response including events from before the request was made or
a range of events, by specifying `from` and `to` query parameters with
timestamps in unix epoch milliseconds. For example:

- `/data/stream/{id}/events?from=1635437394` to get all events since
  `Oct 28 16:09:54Z 2021` (exclusively) and stay connected for live events.
- `/data/stream/{id}/events?from=1635437394000&to=1635447394000` to get all
  events between `Oct 28 16:09:54Z 2021` and `Oct 28 18:56:34Z 2021`
  (inclusively).

Finally, we recomend using the events API mostly for debugging purposes, for
example to get all available information about a live stream to find any issues.
The specific events that are published and their respective schemas will keep
evolving over time so are still subject to changes.
