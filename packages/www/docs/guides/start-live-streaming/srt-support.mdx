# SRT Support

SRT ingest is supported for all users and is currently in Beta. To stream in
SRT, change your stream URL to:

`srt://rtmp.livepeer.com:2935?streamid={stream-key}`

The SRT ingest URL is also included in the Dashboard, making it easy to copy and paste. It can be found below the RTMP ingest URL on the Stream Detail page. 

There is no need to use a stream key when using the SRT ingest URL, as the stream key is already included. 

Streaming with SRT is compatible with OBS but may not be compatible with all
encoders, including Streamlabs OBS. Please ensure that your encoder is compatible with SRT.
