# Use a custom domain for live streaming

The Livepeer Studio global-optimized ingest URL is
`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}`.

You can CNAME `rtmp.livepeer.com` to customize that URL to something with
your brand, for example `rtmp.companyname.io`. You can configure this with your
DNS provider.
