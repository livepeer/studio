# Tutorial: How to implement a player into your front end application using Video.js

In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to setup a player using video.js and
[Livepeer Video Services](http://livepeer.com) into your front end application
for live streaming and video-on-demand.

Although we’re using Video.js in this tutorial, there are lots of players that
you can choose from that are compatible with Livepeer — .Video.js is designed to
be a reliable and consistent base to build on top of. The player looks great out
of the box, but can be easily styled with a little bit of extra CSS.

### What you’ll need to get started:

Hello

1. [Create an Account on Livepeer.com](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Create-an-Account-014abcb50f42473089bf844190af61e5)
2. [Retrieve a playback URL from a stream or an asset](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/playback)
3. [Choose how you’d like to stream: OBS or In-Browser](https://livepeer.com/blog/stream-into-livepeer-video-services-first-time)

## How to build a player using just HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Method 1: Copy and Paste

Check out [codepen](https://codepen.io/codentell/pen/XWVGwjV) full source code —
drop in a playback URL (should look like
`https://livepeercdn.com/hls/1fcae6n18ljto86h/index.m3u8`) in the
`src attribute` field.

Example:

```html
<video-js
  id="example-video"
  width="960"
  height="540"
  class="vjs-default-skin"
  controls>
  <source
    src="<https://livepeercdn.com/hls/1fcae6n18ljto86h/index.m3u8>"
    type="application/x-mpegURL" />
</video-js>
```

### Method 2: Build step-by-step

- Create a folder for your project. Example: `livepeer-player-sample`

```
mkdir livepeer-player-sample

```

- Create an `index.html` inside the project folder

```
cd livepeer-player-sample
touch index.html

```

- Using the code below, replace the `{{ENTER YOUR PLAYBACK URL }}` with your own
  Playback URL. It should look similar to this:
  `https://livepeercdn.com/hls/1fcae6n18ljto86h/index.m3u8`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Video.js with Livepeer</title>
    <link
      href="<https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.18.1/video-js.css>"
      rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <video-js
      id="livepeer-sample-videojs-player"
      width="960"
      height="540"
      class="vjs-default-skin"
      controls>
      <source src="{{ENTER YOUR PLAYBACK URL}}" type="application/x-mpegURL" />
    </video-js>
  </body>
  <script src="<https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.18.1/video.min.js>"></script>
  <script src="<https://unpkg.com/@videojs/http-streaming@2.14.2/dist/videojs-http-streaming.min.js>"></script>
  <script>
    var player = videojs("livepeer-sample-videojs-player");
    player.play();
  </script>
</html>
```

⚠️ Head’s up! ⚠️ If you’re using a playback URL for a stream, it will only show
while a stream is active.

### 🎉 Congrats! You now have a player! 🎉

Note: Livepeer.com works with any video player that supports HLS live streams.
Other considerations are if the player provides analytics out of the box and if
you can easily style the player.
