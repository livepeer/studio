# Usage and Billing

Login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and navigate to the Usage tab, [livepeer.com/app/user/usage](/app/user/usage). On this page, you can track your transcoding usage over the current billing cycle. Livepeer.com does not currently charge for stream delivery via CDN or recording storage. We’ll be sure to reach out before we start to do so.

You can also view past invoices and what Livepeer.com plan you were subscribed to during that billing cycle.

To upgrade, downgrade or change your credit card information, login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and navigate to the Plans tab, [livepeer.com/app/user/plans](/app/user/plans).
