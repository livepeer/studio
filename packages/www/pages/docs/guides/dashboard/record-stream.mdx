# How to record stream sessions with the Livepeer.com Dashboard

*Please note this beta feature is a new and still being optimized. Send feedback to help@livepeer.com.*

**Recording Livepeer.com livestreams is easy.**
- Recording is turned off by default
- **Record ON** means that new sessions are recorded.
- **Record OFF** means that new sessions are not recorded.
- When updating this setting, note that in progress sessions will adhere to the on/off setting when the livestream began. The changed setting only applies to *new* stream sessions.
- The adaptive bitrate (ABR) settings for the recording are inherited from the transcoding profiles set for the livestream. At this time you cannot set recording-specific ABR settings. 
- Playback is delivered via Livepeer.com's CDN by default.

## Turn recording on/off
Open your Livepeer.com account and navigate to the *streams list page*, https://livepeer.com/app/user, and create a new stream or click on existing stream. You will be redirected to the *stream page*.

In the **Recording sessions** row, select **Record ON** to turn recording on or **Record OFF** to turn recording off.

The page will refresh, saving your recording settings.

## Recording playback URL
The session recording playback URL will be available about 5 minutes after the live stream ends and will appear in the **session table** at the bottom of the **stream page**. *Note the **session table** only appears after one completed livestreaming session.*
