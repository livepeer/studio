# How to verify stream status with the Livepeer.com API

To verify a stream is running, you can fetch the stream status by sending a
`GET` request to `https://livepeer.com/api/stream/` with the stream object `id`
appended. You received the `id` in the response when you
[created a stream object](/docs/guides/api/create-a-stream).

Here is an example request:

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}"
```

This is an example response:

```bash
{
  "name":"test_stream",
  "profiles":[
    {"bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"height":720,"name":"720p","width":1280},
    {"bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"height":480,"name":"480p","width":854},
    {"bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"height":360,"name":"360p","width":640}],
  "id":"2d10f1fd-dbf7-495b-8aef-08916507fcce",
  "createdAt":1596118509635,
  "isActive":true,
  "lastSeen":1596119750455
}
```

`isActive: true` means video segments are currently being ingested by Livepeer.com. `isActive: false` means the live stream is *idle* and no video segments are currently being ingested by Livepeer.com. 

`lastSeen` represents when the stream was last observed by the monitoring
system. The time is reported in Unix epoch time. If the stream is running, the
epoch will be close to the current time.
