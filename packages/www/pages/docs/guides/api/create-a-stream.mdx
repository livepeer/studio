# How to create a stream with the Livepeer.com API

Send a `POST` request to `https://livepeer.com/api/stream`.

This creates a new *parent* `stream` object. The `id` in the POST request response will be the `parentId` for all future *session* `stream` objects for this stream. This [guide](/docs/guides/api/parent-streams-and-sessions) explains the relationship between parent-config and child-session `stream` objects.

Use the API key as a part of the authorization header, and use a JSON body to
specify the configuration for the stream. The only parameter you are required to
set is the `name` of your stream, but we also highly recommend that you define
the `profiles` parameter with 720p, 480p and 360p renditions.

If you do not define transcoding rendition profiles when creating the stream, no
transcoding will happen. Your playback video will have the attributes of the
source stream only, will not take advantage of adaptive bitrate streaming and
will likely buffer.

Here is an example request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "480p",
      "bitrate": 1000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 854,
      "height": 480
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
}' \
https://livepeer.com/api/stream
```

This is an example stream object response to the request above:

```bash
{
    "name":"test_stream",
    "profiles":[
        {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},
        {"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480}],
        {"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360}],
    "id":"0bf161f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
    "createdAt":1596081229373,
    "streamKey":"rlmn-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
    "playbackId":"emh3b2mxupongp5k"
}
```

`streamKey`, `playbackId`, and `id` (a.k.a. the stream ID) are unique to the
stream object and important to remember.
