# How to playback a recorded session

Use `/stream/<parentId>/sessions?record=1` to a return list of recorded sessions with the same `parentId` using `record=1`

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer <api key>' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/<parentId>/sessions?record=1"
```

A livestream session recording is available approximately 5 minutes after the livestream session has ended. When the recording is ready, the most recent session `stream` object `recordingStatus` value will change from `waiting` to `ready`.  

> ⚠️ You will need to poll this endpoint to get the updated `recordingStatus` values of all listed recorded sessions. In the future, we will support webhooks.

Once the recording is ready, the session `stream` object's `recordingUrl` parameter will return the .m3u8 recording playback URL. 

The recording playback URL will look something like this: `https://region-cdn.livepeer.com/recordings/<id-of-stream-session>/index.m3u8`. View the live stream with any HLS video player.

Next, learn [how to list all `stream` objects](/docs/guides/api/list-all-streams).
