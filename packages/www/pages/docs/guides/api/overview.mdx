# How to live stream with the Livepeer.com API

This section of the docs will walk you through how to set up your integration
with the Livepeer.com API.

If you are creating a live streaming platform or application, integrating with
the Livepeer.com API will best meet your needs.

The only prerequisite for using the plethora of features in the Livepeer.com API
is to be able to create a RTMP stream. [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) or
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) are popular options for creating an RTMP stream,
but you can also use any RTMP library, for example
[Streamaxia](https://www.streamaxia.com/) in iOS.

If you haven’t already, the first thing you’ll need to do is
[create an account on Livepeer.com](/docs/guides/account/create-an-account).

Then [create an API key](/docs/guides/api-keys/create-an-api-key) in the
Livepeer.com admin dashboard.

Next, learn about the
[relationship between parent-config and child-session `stream` objects](/docs/guides/api/parent-streams-and-sessions). Understanding this is a core concept that will make using the Livepeer.com API simple.
