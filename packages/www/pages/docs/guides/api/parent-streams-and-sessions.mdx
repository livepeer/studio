# The relationship between parent-config and child-session `stream` objects

Livestreaming with Livepeer.com is easy. The first step is understanding the `stream` object.  

## There are two types of `stream` objects.
- **A** ***child***  **`stream` object is a single live streaming session.**
- **A** ***parent*** **`stream` object shows the configuration and metadata totals of all its *child* stream sessions.**

Here are some core concepts about the `stream` object:
- The `parentId` of a child-session `stream` object is the same as the `id` of its parent stream object.
- Child-session `stream` objects are read-only.
- Parent `stream` objects are read-write.
- The playback URL for a live (`isActive: true`) parent `stream` object is the same for all its sessions.
- The recording playback URL for each completed live streaming session is unique and available as a parameter on the child-session `stream` object when requesting a list of stream sessions.
