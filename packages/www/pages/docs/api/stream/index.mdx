# Stream

## There are two types of `stream` objects.
- **A** ***child***  **`stream` object is a single live streaming session.**
- **A** ***parent*** **`stream` object shows the configuration and metadata totals of all its *child* stream sessions.**

**Core concepts** about the `stream` object parent-child relationship:
- The `parentId` of a child-session `stream` object is same as the `id` of its parent stream object.
- Child-session `stream` objects are read-only.
- Parent `stream` objects are read-write.
- The playback URL for a live (`isActive: true`) parent `stream` object is the same for all its sessions.
- The recording playback URL for each completed live streaming session is unique and available as a parameter on the child-session `stream` object.

| `profiles`                   | array   | Transcoding rendition settings. The source will be delivered with the renditions in the HLS and does not need to be redefined in the `profiles` parameter. If no `profiles` are defined, only the source will be delivered for playback. |

| `record         `            | boolean | On a parent `stream` object, `true` means that new sessions are recorded, and `false` means they are not.

| `transcodedSegments`         | number  | Number of asset transcoded rendition segments processed. Should be (`sourceSegments` \* number of `profiles`).                                                                                                                           |
