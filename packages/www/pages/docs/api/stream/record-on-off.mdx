# `PATCH /stream/<id>/record` to turn on/off recording

`PATCH /stream/<id>/record` can only modify a *parent* stream object. The *parent* `record` value is inherited by all future child-session `stream` objects. Child-session `stream` objects are read-only.

### turn recording on

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.com/api/stream/<id>/record \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <api key>' \
-d '{"record":true}'
```

### turn recording off

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.com/api/stream/<id>/record \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <api key>' \
-d '{"record":false}'
```
