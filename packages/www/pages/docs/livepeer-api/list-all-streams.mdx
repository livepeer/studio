### List All Streams

You can list all of the streams created by an user.  To do so, you will need the "userId".  

You can find your userId by fetching the API key information:

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/api-token/{api_key}"
```

You will get the API key object.  For example:

```jsx
{
	"id":"d210eded-46a9-4119-86f9-64c33e003f1b",
	"userId":"4ecd4b74-9908-4d23-be05-58e2480e752a",
	"name":"test-7-29-2020",
	"createdAt":1596047053660
}
```

Now, you can use the "userId" to fetch all the streams created by the user.  For example:

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/user/{user_id}"
```
