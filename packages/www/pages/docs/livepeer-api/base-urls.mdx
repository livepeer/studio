### How to Get Base URLs

There are 2 types of base URLs:
* The ingest base URL is a part of the (rtmp) ingest URL, used for the broadcaster to ingest the video stream. 
* The playback base URL is a part of the playback URL, used for the viewers to watch the stream.

You can get the base URLs by calling `https://livepeer.com/api/ingest`.  For example:
```bash
curl "https://livepeer.com/api/ingest"
```

And you should get results like

```jsx
[{"ingest":"rtmp://mdw-rtmp.livepeer.com/live",
"playback":"https://mdw-cdn.livepeer.com/hls"}]
```

*Note: the results will depend on the location you issue the request from.* This is important, because the ingest point should be as close to the broadcaster as possible.
