### Using Livepeer to do live streaming

You can live stream by using the livepeer.com application, or using the Livepeer API.

##### [livepeer.com](/docs/livepeer-dot-com/create-a-stream)

If you are doing manual broadcasts like streaming events, concerts, or webinars, you can use livepeer.com.  

You can manually create streams, and directly use broadasting software like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to broadcast into the streams.


##### Livepeer API

If you are creating a live streaming platform or app, the Livepeer API will best meet your needs.

The only prerequisite for using RTMP features in the Livepeer API is to be able to create a RTMP stream. [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) or [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) are popular options for creating an RTMP stream, but you can also use any RTMP library, for example [Streamaxia](https://www.streamaxia.com/) in iOS.
