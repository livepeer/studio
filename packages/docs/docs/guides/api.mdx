# API requests

The Livepeer Studio API is a live video streaming API. With the Livepeer Studio
API, you or the client can configure details for live broadcasting software,
generate a playback URL for stream viewers, get usage data about your stream
sessions and more. Explore the [Livepeer Studio API reference](/references) for
more information.

The Livepeer Studio API base url is `https://livepeer.com/api/`. As you make
requests, the Livepeer Studio API returns JSON responses.

## Authentication

The Livepeer Studio API uses API keys to authenticate most requests, including
all requests associated with creating and retrieving a stream or session object.

The Livepeer Studio API uses Bearer authentication. You or the client must send
an API key in the Authorization header when making requests to protected
information:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. API requests without proper
authentication will fail.

## Errors

The Livepeer Studio API uses conventional HTTP status codes.

`2XX` = success

`4XX` = client error, problem with information provided

`5XX` = internal server error, problem with Livepeer Studio servers
