  /asset/request-upload:
    post:
      operationId: requestUpload
      summary: Upload an asset
      description: |
        To upload an asset, your first need to request for a direct upload URL
        and only then actually upload the contents of the asset.
        \
        \
        Once you created a upload link, you have 2 options, resumable or direct
        upload. For a more reliable experience, you should use resumable uploads
        which will work better for users with unreliable or slow network
        connections. If you want a simpler implementation though, you should
        just use a direct upload.


        ## Direct Upload
        For a direct upload, make a PUT request to the URL received in the url
        field of the response above, with the raw video file as the request
        body. response above:


        ## Resumable Upload
        Livepeer supports resumable uploads via Tus. This section provides a
        simple example of how to use tus-js-client to upload a video file.
        \
        \
        From the previous section, we generated a URL to upload a video file to
        Livepeer on POST /api/asset/request-upload. You should use the
        tusEndpoint field of the response to upload the video file and track the
        progress:

        ```
        # This assumes there is an `input` element of `type="file"` with id
        `fileInput` in the HTML


        const input = document.getElementById('fileInput');

        const file = input.files[0];

        const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
          endpoint: tusEndpoint, // URL from `tusEndpoint` field in the
        `/request-upload` response
          metadata: {
            filename,
            filetype: 'video/mp4',
          },
          uploadSize: file.size,
          onError(err) {
            console.error('Error uploading file:', err);
          },
          onProgress(bytesUploaded, bytesTotal) {
            const percentage = ((bytesUploaded / bytesTotal) * 100).toFixed(2);
            console.log('Uploaded ' + percentage + '%');
          },
          onSuccess() {
            console.log('Upload finished:', upload.url);
          },
        });

        const previousUploads = await upload.findPreviousUploads();

        if (previousUploads.length > 0) {
          upload.resumeFromPreviousUpload(previousUploads[0]);
        }

        upload.start();

        ```

        > Note: If you are using tus from node.js, you need to add a custom URL
        storage to enable resuming from previous uploads. On the browser, this
        is enabled by default using local storage. In node.js, add urlStorage:
        new tus.FileUrlStorage("path/to/tmp/file"), to the UploadFile object
        definition above.

        The publicKey is a representation of the public key, encoded as base 64

        creation. This is the only moment where the client can save the private
        key, otherwise it will be lost. Remember to decode your string when
        signing JWTs.

        Up to 10 signing keys can be generated, after that you must delete at

      summary: Transcode a video
      description: |
        `POST /transcode` transcodes a video file and uploads the results to the
        specified storage service.
        \
        \
        Transcoding is asynchronous so you will need to check the status of the
        task in order to determine when transcoding is complete. The `id` field
        in the response is the unique ID for the transcoding `Task`. The task
        status can be queried using the [GET tasks
        endpoint](https://docs.livepeer.org/reference/api/get-tasks):
        \
        \
        When `status.phase` is `completed`,  transcoding will be complete and
        the results will be stored in the storage service and the specified
        output location.
        \
        \
        The results will be available under `params.outputs.hls.path` and
        `params.outputs.mp4.path` in the specified storage service.
        ## Input
        \
        This endpoint currently supports the following inputs:
        - HTTP
        - S3 API Compatible Service
        \
        \
        **HTTP**
        \
        A public HTTP URL can be used to read a video file.
        ```json
        {
            "url": "https://www.example.com/video.mp4"
        }
        ```
        | Name | Type   | Description                          |
        | ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
        | url  | string | A public HTTP URL for the video file. |

        Note: For IPFS HTTP gateway URLs, the API currently only supports “path
        style” URLs and does not support “subdomain style” URLs. The API will
        support both styles of URLs in a future update.
        \
        \
        **S3 API Compatible Service**
        \
        \
        S3 credentials can be used to authenticate with a S3 API compatible
        service to read a video file.

        ```json
        {
            "type": "s3",
            "endpoint": "https://gateway.storjshare.io",

        }
        ```


        ## Storage
        \
        This endpoint currently supports the following storage services:
        - S3 API Compatible Service
        - Web3 Storage
        \
